# ES_Autotune

## Plan
- initialize mic
- find a way to load and store the file (maybe SD?)
- focusing solely on input? Not focusing on both input and output, solely input.
- see Adam's code and see how the software should ride off the back of that
    - once we understand what he has, we'll be able to update and branch off of his systemverilog-to-be code; but will attempt 1-3 in the meantime

## Things to Add
- AudioCODEC: controls to send it to the signal
- I2S
- Speaker?
